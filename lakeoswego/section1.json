        "description": "The Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana) is an iconic tree for many of us. Adults stand up to 90 feet tall and spread their branches wide over the surrounding grasslands.  This tree species has become an increasing focus for conservationists in recent years, as the important role it plays as a keystone species in many habitats of the Northwest has become more and more clear.",

This is especially true of oak woodlands, which are open, grassy, often riparian areas where mature oak trees grow and have room to spread their canopies, as well as oak savannas which are drier. Oaks can grow in a diverse range of soils, including both well-drained and moist soils, but are sensitive to competition from other tree species <a href='https://www.oregonconservationstrategy.org/strategy-habitat/oak-woodlands/' target='_blank'> [1] </a> . In addition, they are slow growing and saplings are easily driven out by invasive undergrowth species.",

When European settlers arrived in the region, they cut down oaks to clear space for farmland and timber plantations.
